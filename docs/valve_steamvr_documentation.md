Typically after you complete the [SteamVR HDK License](steamvr_license_setup.md), you will obtain access to the SteamVR HDK in Steam.  This will download a folder to your PC's Steam folder.

Typically the Steam Folder is located in:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam
```

The location where you will find the documentation is:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR Tracking HDK
```

Please refer to the `\docs` folder for documents and the `\traning` folder for guided presentation slides
